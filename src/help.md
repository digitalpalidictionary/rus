# Coding Help Needed!

I am looking for some help with coding various aspects of the Digital P캐拷을 Dictionary Project. If you have the expertise and the interest, [please get in touch by email](mailto:digitalpalidictionary@gmail.com)

## JavaScript

I would like to integrate DPD into [The Buddha's Words website](https://thebuddhaswords.net/home/index.html). There is currently a P캐拷을 dictionary lookup system, but it is very outdated - the same as on Sutta Central. I have devised a method to give [more accurate word-recognition](https://github.com/digitalpalidictionary/dpd-db/tree/main/tbw) and need some assistance with the JavaScript implementation. I don't think it will be very complex. Once created, the same system can be easily re-used in other websites.

## Flutter

As a part of a longer-term vision, I would like to develop DPD into a Flutter App, which would replicate the current lookup functionality of GoldenDict, and further allow the integration of many requested features which are not possible within the GoldenDict framework. The backend would be a SQLite database, and methods to lookup and present the relevant data. This is a longer, more complex project.
